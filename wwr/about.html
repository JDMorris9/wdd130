                <p>Our mission is to provide you with an adventure your ancestors will roll over in their
                    graves about! We aim to break up the average-ordinary-every-day-placeholderly antics with 
                    no small amount of nonsense, malarky, buffoonery, and a sprinkle of chaos! So get ready 
                    for some useless dribble, because we're bringing the party to you!</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time, we had a life that was, well, lame. From that lameness was born a dream. 
                A dream that one day, no one would ever have to have a life that is lame! So we started a 
                business, utilizing the least lame thing we could think of. The overthrow of the free world 
                and all semblance of physics and gravity as we know it! But we couldn't get the licensing 
                for that, so we settled on rafting instead. Hope you think it's just as cool as we do, and 
                stuff. Even though it was our second choice, we hope it will be your first!</p>

            <p>My name is Janae Morris, and I love animals, writing, and gaming. My husband and I have been 
                happily married since 2016. We have a fixer-upper of a house with some property, and there we 
                keep chickens, ducks, and more cars than we can keep running at a time. We recently adopted two 
                kittens, who we've named Gomez and Herman--sometimes affectionately known as Mr. Addams and Mr. 
                Munster. They have brought a lot of joy and shouts of "NO!" to our household so far. It's a good 
                thing they are so adorable.</p>
            <p>My ultimate goal in life, since the fourth grade, has been to become an author. I have come 
                to expand on that goal by making plans to start a publishing company. Throughout the years, I 
                have come to make close friendships with a lot of other writers, who share some of the same 
                struggles I do with the writing industry, so I am passionate about the process and hope to help 
                other writers break into the industry. I mean to use my skills as a software developer to help 
                build this into a successful company.

            <p>Boasting a rich cultural history and a dynamic landscape, Utah is one of the most 
                beautiful states in the USA. If you're looking to hike, ski, or enjoy a day of fishing
                out on the lake, Utah is the place to be. The deserts here are colorful and full of life, 
                with breathtaking locations such as Arches National Park, High Uintas, and Goblin Valley.
                Utah is also home to home to 3.5 million people with a great range of diversity. Utah is 
                truly a one-of-a-kind place to be!</p>
